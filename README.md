# Obsidian Templates

This repository contains my customised templates for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a powerful knowledge base and note-taking application. These templates are designed to streamline workflows, enhance organisation, and support efficient note-taking.

## Contents

- **Daily Notes**: A template for capturing daily logs, tasks, and reflections.
- **Meeting Notes**: A structured template for recording meeting agendas, key points, and action items.
- **Project Management**: A template for planning and tracking project milestones.
- **Research Notes**: A format for organising research findings, references, and analysis.
- **Writing/Outlines**: Templates to assist in drafting essays, articles, or creative writing.
